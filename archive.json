      "body": "**Action**: Marisol to review documentation from vendors, on product specification on accuracy/precision, power factor implementation.\n\nThe idea is to include as a question for the working group on next Monday call:\n\nVendors SHOULD document the sensor type, calibration\nmethod, and the expected measurement precision, as these factors are\ndistinct from accuracy but influence interpretation of the reported data?\n\n**Action**: based on this, we need to consider to include clarification/terminology in the draft(s)\n\nsome relevant text to consider:\n\n- Accuracy\n\nDescribes how close a measured or estimated power value is to the true physical value.\n\nExamples:\n\n\u201c\u00b110% of the actual power consumption\u201d\n\n\u201cDerived from model, low fidelity\u201d\n\n\u201cDirect sensor measurement, high accuracy\u201d\n\n- Precision\n\nDescribes the granularity or repeatability of the measurement \u2014 e.g., number of digits, stability of repeated reads.\n\nExamples:\n\nA sensor that reads 100.1 W, 100.2 W, 100.1 W is precise.\n\nBut if the real consumption is 120 W, the readings are precise but inaccurate.\n\n\nSome more reasoning:\n\n- A dataset may have high precision, low accuracy (stable but wrong).\n- Or high accuracy, low precision (on average right, but noisy).\n- Operators need accuracy for carbon reporting and power budgets.\n- Engineers need precision to troubleshoot variations or detect anomalies.\n\nCould it be something also to consider under Terminology or specific section (suggested text, to be discussed!!)\n*  Accuracy versus Precision\n\n   In the context of Power and Energy Monitoring, this document uses the\n   term \"accuracy\" to describe how close a reported measurement is to the\n   true physical value. Accuracy may be based on direct sensor readings,\n   learned models, historic data, or manufacturer specifications.\n   The \"data-source-accuracy\" identity hierarchy captures the expected\n   error bounds or fidelity category of the reported value.\n\n   While accuracy describes closeness to the true value, it is distinct\n   from \"precision\", which refers to the repeatability, granularity, or\n   number of valid digits in a measurement. A measurement may be highly\n   precise yet inaccurate (e.g., stable readings that are offset from the\n   real value), or accurate on average but with low precision (e.g.,\n   noisy measurements).\n\n   The accuracy identities defined in this module characterize the source\n   and expected error bounds of the reported measurement but do not, by\n   themselves, define the precision of the underlying sensor or data\n   representation. Systems implementing this module MAY expose additional\n   metadata such as sampling resolution, number of significant digits, or\n   sensor calibration information to describe precision where relevant.\n\nBased on first action, consider to add a question to the WG:\nThe \"accuracy-measured\" category indicates that the value originates from\na physical sensor. Vendors SHOULD document the sensor type, calibration\nmethod, and the expected measurement precision, as these factors are\ndistinct from accuracy but influence interpretation of the reported data.",
