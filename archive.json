Accuracy may be based on direct sensor readings,\n   learned models, historic data, or manufacturer specifications.\n   The \"data-source-accuracy\" identity hierarchy captures the expected\n   error bounds or fidelity category of the reported value.\n\n   While accuracy describes closeness to the true value, it is distinct\n   from \"precision\", which refers to the repeatability, granularity, or\n   number of valid digits in a measurement. A measurement may be highly\n   precise yet inaccurate (e.g., stable readings that are offset from the\n   real value), or accurate on average but with low precision (e.g.,\n   noisy measurements).\n\n   The accuracy identities defined in this module characterize the source\n   and expected error bounds of the reported measurement but do not, by\n   themselves, define the precision of the underlying sensor or data\n   representation. Systems implementing this module MAY expose additional\n   metadata such as sampling resolution, number of significant digits, or\n   sensor calibration information to describe precision where relevant.\n\nBased on first action, consider to add a question to the WG:\nThe \"accuracy-measured\" category indicates that the value originates from\na physical sensor. Vendors SHOULD document the sensor type, calibration\nmethod, and the expected measurement precision, as these factors are\ndistinct from accuracy but influence interpretation of the reported data.",
